First Task
original node attributes
average attributes of 1-hop neighbors
average attributes of 10-hop neighbors
=> predict the original node label using ML

Second Task
average one-hot label vector of 1-hop neighbors
average one-hot label vector of 10-hop neighbors
=> pick the largest index as the predicted label

Third Task
original node attributes
weighted average attributes of 1-hop neighbors
weighted average of 10-hop neighbors
=> predict the original node label using MLP
=> how to compute weights? 1. dot product, 2. concatenation attention 3. square attention
